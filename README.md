<h1 align="center">Welcome!</h1>

ðŸ’¬ I'm the Head of Protocol Engineering at <a href="https://superform.xyz">Superform</a>. Ask me any questions about the protocol or check out our public repos below. 

My focus area for the past few years has been leading high performing solidity development teams while taking the most advanced smart contracts development, testing and auditing tasks. I am heavily focused in using **Foundry** as my day to day frame work, and have 5 years of experience with Solidity development. I'm also skilled in full-stack web3 development with **Typescript, React, GraphQL (Subgraphs & Prisma), Ethers.js and Next.js**.
